        Challenge: Using an example we haven't explored in class (no cars or animals), explain how class inheritance works by creating two classes below.  
        
        IRL Moment: Imagine this is technical interview question. Obviously the person who is asking the question knows how inheritance works, so do your best to explain how much *you* know. The more clear the picture you paint for your interviewer, the more likely they are to find you technically proficient. In other words, choose your code wisely, but more importantly, comment EVERYTHING.
