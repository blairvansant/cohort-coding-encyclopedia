# Git Workflow

Imagine you and your study group are working as a team in a company. You are in the middle of a project, and you need to keep your working git branch (let's call it the Development branch) separate from your Master branch which represents what is live on your website.

Keeping in mind that you and your team are great at feature branching for each ticket you are assigned, and that every other week you deploy to production (and merge your working Development branch into your Master branch), make a diagram that represents your code in GitHub and all of your clone versions on your computers. It should look somewhat like https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/GitFlowHotfixBranch.png .
